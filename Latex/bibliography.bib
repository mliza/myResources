First, a high-temperature computational fluid dynamics code was benchmarked and correlated with experimental results, emphasizing the impact of high-temperature effects as well as turbulence modeling on heat flux prediction. Subsequently, an aerothermal surrogate based on the multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression method was developed. The model achieves a balance between model accuracy and computational cost of sample generation, using the combination of a few high-fidelity sample and many low-fidelity samples. Finally, the new aerothermal surrogate was applied to study the impact of the hightemperature effect on the aerothermoelastic response of a hypersonic skin panel, emphasizing the necessity of the accurate characterization of the localized heat flux for reasonable assessment of the response of a compliant structure in high-speed high-temperature flowfield.},

These are the first LES studies to reproduce the instantaneous structure of the scalar-energy field φ̄2(x,t) at viscous-convective scales in the high Schmidt-number regime. The simulations employ a refinement of the nLES method with multifractal modeling first proposed by G. C. Burton and W. J. A. Dahm [Phys. Fluids 17, 075111 (2005)]. In this approach, the nonlinear inertial stresses uiuj in the filtered Navier-Stokes equation and the nonlinear scalar fluxes ujφ in the filtered advection-diffusion equation are calculated directly, using multifractal models for the subgrid velocity and scalar fields, ujsgs and φsgs. Resolved energy levels are controlled by a new adaptive backscatter limiter that adjusts locally to changing flow conditions consistent with the mechanism governing energy transfer in actual hydrodynamic turbulence. No artificial viscosity or diffusivity closures are applied and no explicit de-aliasing is performed. The nLES approach is shown to simulate accurately Sc≈1 mixing for flows between Reλ≈35 and 4100, the highest Reλ tested. Characteristics of the resulting scalar field are examined, including the turbulence-to-scalar time-scale ratio and total scalar variance 〈φ′2〉, indicating good agreement with prior studies. Simulations between Sc=8 and 8192 produce the first scalar-energy spectra from an LES that exhibit k-1 scaling in the viscous-convective range, consistent with the analytical prediction of G. K.

   abstract = {The effects of isothermal initial stratification on the dynamics of the vorticity for single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) are examined using two-dimensional fully compressible wavelet-based direct numerical simulations. The simulations model low Atwood number (A=0.04) RTI development for four different initial stratification strengths, corresponding to Mach numbers from 0.3 (weakly stratified) to 1.2 (strongly stratified), and for three different Reynolds numbers, from 25 500 to 102 000. Here, the Mach number is based on the Atwood-independent gravity wave speed and characterizes the strength of the initial stratification. All simulations use adaptive wavelet-based mesh refinement to achieve very fine spatial resolutions at relatively low computational cost. For all stratifications, the RTI bubble and spike go through the exponential growth regime, followed by a slowing of the RTI evolution. For the weakest stratification, this slow-down is then followed by a reacceleration, while for stronger stratifications, the suppression of RTI growth continues. Bubble and spike asymmetries are observed for weak stratifications, with bubble and spike growth rates becoming increasingly similar as the stratification strength increases. For the range of cases studied, there is relatively little effect of Reynolds number on bubble and spike heights, although the formation of secondary vortices becomes more pronounced as Reynolds number increases. The underlying dynamics are analyzed in detail through an examination of the vorticity transport equation, revealing that incompressible baroclinicity drives RTI growth for small and moderate stratifications but increasingly leads to the suppression of vorticity production and RTI growth for stronger stratifications. These variations in baroclinicity are used to explain the suppression of RTI growth for strong stratifications, as well as the anomalous asymmetry in bubble and spike growth rates for weak stratifications.},

The relevant mathematical tool, fractal interpolation, allows to interpolate the resolved velocity with fields that have fluctuations down to much smaller scales and to compute the required stresses explicitly. In one dimension, the approach is used in the context of the coarse-grained Burgers equation. Then, fractal interpolation is extended to three dimensions and is used to formulate a subgrid model for the filtered Navier-Stokes equations. The model is applied to LES of both steady and freely decaying isotropic turbulence. We find that the assumption of fractality per se is not enough to yield physically meaningful results, and we explore several variants of the model in which the rules to generate the synthetic fields explicitly incorporate the condition that energy dissipation take place. In one dimension, this is accomplished by means of an additional transport equation that allows to dynamically determine the fractal dimension. In three dimensions, good results are obtained only once the fractal dimension is allowed to vary in different eigendirections of the resolved strain-rate tensor so as to (nearly) maximize energy dissipation. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Many high-order shock-capturing and shock-fitting finite-difference methods have been developed and extensively applied to numerical simulations of the hypersonic boundary-layer transition. DNS has become a powerful research tool and has led to discoveries of new transition mechanisms.

   abstract = {A new theory of coherent structure in wall turbulence is presented. The theory is the first to predict packets of hairpin vortices and other structure in turbulence, and their dynamics, based on an analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations, under an assumption of a turbulent mean profile. The assumption of the turbulent mean acts as a restriction on the class of possible structures. It is shown that the coherent structure is a manifestation of essentially low-dimensional flow dynamics, arising from a critical-layer mechanism. Using the decomposition presented in McKeon & Sharma (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 658, 2010, pp. 336-382), complex coherent structure is recreated from minimal superpositions of response modes predicted by the analysis, which take the form of radially varying travelling waves. The leading modes effectively constitute a low-dimensional description of the turbulent flow, which is optimal in the sense of describing the resonant effects around the critical layer and which minimally predicts all types of structure. The approach is general for the full range of scales. By way of example, simple combinations of these modes are offered that predict hairpins and modulated hairpin packets. The example combinations are chosen to represent observed structure, consistent with the nonlinear triadic interaction for wavenumbers that is required for self-interaction of structures. The combination of the three leading response modes at streamwise wavenumbers 6, 1, 7 and spanwise wavenumbers ± 6, ± 6, ± 12, respectively, with phase velocity 2/3, is understood to represent a turbulence 'kernel', which, it is proposed, constitutes a self-exciting process analogous to the near-wall cycle. Together, these interactions explain how the mode combinations may self-organize and self-sustain to produce experimentally observed structure. The phase interaction also leads to insight into skewness and correlation results known in the literature. It is also shown that the very large-scale motions act to organize hairpin-like structures such that they co-locate with areas of low streamwise momentum, by a mechanism of locally altering the shear profile. These energetic streamwise structures arise naturally from the resolvent analysis, rather than by a summation of hairpin packets. In addition, these packets are modulated through a 'beat' effect. The relationship between Taylor's hypothesis and coherence is discussed, and both are shown to be the consequence of the localization of the response modes around the critical layer. A pleasing link is made to the classical laminar inviscid theory, whereby the essential mechanism underlying the hairpin vortex is captured by two obliquely interacting Kelvin-Stuart (cat's eye) vortices. Evidence for the theory is presented based on comparison with observations of structure in turbulent flow reported in the experimental and numerical simulation literature and with exact solutions reported in the transitional literature. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the planar velocity fields measured via two-dimensional particle image velocimetry, together with a spatio-temporal coherence analysis, shows that the first four leading-order POD modes share both geometric similarity and dynamic coherence and jointly depict the downstream convection of the large-scale Q2/Q4 events, which can be regarded as the low-order imprints of the hairpin packets. A simple low-order indicator is then proposed to extract the inclined interfaces of the hairpin packets, based on which a two-point conditional correlation analysis forms a statistical picture of the spatial organization of multiple prograde vortices aligned along the interface within one packet. A saturation of the self-similar growth of the streamwise gap between two neighbouring vortices is seen. This implies a detachment of the hairpin packets from the inner layer. Both the detachment height and the saturated streamwise spacing are found to scale as Re1/2τ.},

By looking at the velocity directions of the neighbourhood of a point we decide if there is rotation. A measure of the strength of rotation at the point is also introduced based on the magnitude of the velocity components in the neighbourhood. The method is tested on simulated data and per-forms well. Finally a Lagrangian identification method (Direct Lyapunov Exponents) is used to attempt to calibrate the λ2-criterion in order to match an objectively defined edge.

Different theories and conceptual models were proposed with the aim of controlling the boundary layer flow and improving numerical simulations. Here, we review the different classes of turbulence coherent structures and the presumable genera- tion mechanisms for each. The conceptual models describing the generation of turbulence coherent structures are generally classified under two categories, namely, the bottom-up mechanisms and the top-down mechanisms. The first assumes turbulence to be generated near the surface by some sort of instabilities, whereas the second assigns an active role to the large outer layer structures, perhaps the turbulent bulges. Both categories of models coexist in the flow with the first dominating turbulence generation at low Reynolds number and the second at high Reynolds number, such as the case in the atmospheric boundary layer.},

Two-point spatial velocity correlations computed using the PIV data reveal results that are consistent with an earlier study in which packets of hairpin vortices were identified by a feature-detection algorithm in the log region, but not in the outer wake region. Both streamwise-streamwise (Ruu) and streamwise-wall-normal (Ruw) correlations are significant for streamwise displacements of more than 1500 wall units. Zero crossing data for the streamwise fluctuating component u reveal that streamwise strips between zero crossings of 1500 wall units or longer occur more frequently for negative u than positive u, suggesting that long streamwise correlations in Ruu are dominated by slower streamwise structures. Additional analysis of Rww correlations suggests that the long streamwise slow-moving regions contain discrete zones of strong upwash over extended streamwise distances, as might occur within packets of angled hairpin vortices. At a wall-normal location outside of the log region (z/ δ = 0.5), the correlations are shorter in the streamwise direction and broader in the spanwise direction. Correlations in the inclined cross-stream plane data reveal good agreement with the streamwise-spanwise plane. Ruu in the 45° plane is more elongated along the in-plane wall-normal direction than in the 135° plane, which is consistent with the presence of hairpin packets with a low-speed region lifting away from the wall. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

By the use of the assumption that the heat shield is made of carbon phenolic and by allowing for an arbitrary rate of pyrolysis-gas injection, chemical reactions occurring in the shock layer are postulated, and the collision integrals governing the transport properties, the rate coefficients of the reactions, and the parameters needed for the bifurcation model and for the finite-rate kinetic wall boundary conditions are determined using the best available techniques. Sample flowfield calculations are performed using this set of parameters to show that the heating and surface removal rates are substantially smaller than calculated using the existing set of such parameters and traditional assumptions of gas-surface equilibrium and quasi-steady-state ablation.},

   abstract = {This is the first book specifically designed to offer the student a smooth transitionary course between elementary fluid dynamics (which gives only last-minute attention to turbulence) and the professional literature on turbulent flow, where an advanced viewpoint is assumed.The subject of turbulence, the most forbidding in fluid dynamics, has usually proved treacherous to the beginner, caught in the whirls and eddies of its nonlinearities and statistical imponderables. This is the first book specifically designed to offer the student a smooth transitionary course between elementary fluid dynamics (which gives only last-minute attention to turbulence) and the professional literature on turbulent flow, where an advanced viewpoint is assumed. Moreover, the text has been developed for students, engineers, and scientists with different technical backgrounds and interests. Almost all flows, natural and man-made, are turbulent. Thus the subject is the concern of geophysical and environmental scientists (in dealing with atmospheric jet streams, ocean currents, and the flow of rivers, for example), of astrophysicists (in studying the photospheres of the sun and stars or mapping gaseous nebulae), and of engineers (in calculating pipe flows, jets, or wakes). Many such examples are discussed in the book. The approach taken avoids the difficulties of advanced mathematical development on the one side and the morass of experimental detail and empirical data on the other. As a result of following its midstream course, the text gives the student a physical understanding of the subject and deepens his intuitive insight into those problems that cannot now be rigorously solved. In particular, dimensional analysis is used extensively in dealing with those problems whose exact solution is mathematically elusive. Dimensional reasoning, scale arguments, and similarity rules are introduced at the beginning and are applied throughout. A discussion of Reynolds stress and the kinetic theory of gases provides the contrast needed to put mixing-length theory into proper perspective: the authors present a thorough comparison between the mixing-length models and dimensional analysis of shear flows. This is followed by an extensive treatment of vorticity dynamics, including vortex stretching and vorticity budgets. Two chapters are devoted to boundary-free shear flows and well-bounded turbulent shear flows. The examples presented include wakes, jets, shear layers, thermal plumes, atmospheric boundary layers, pipe and channel flow, and boundary layers in pressure gradients. The spatial structure of turbulent flow has been the subject of analysis in the book up to this point, at which a compact but thorough introduction to statistical methods is given. This prepares the reader to understand the stochastic and spectral structure of turbulence. The remainder of the book consists of applications of the statistical approach to the study of turbulent transport (including diffusion and mixing) and turbulent spectra.},

   abstract = {Prediction of laminar-turbulent transition is a key factor in the design of the heat shield of vehicles (re-)entering a planetary atmosphere. To investigate the transition by means of numerical simulation, accurate and efficient computational methods are necessary. Here, the compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved for a gas where properties such as specific heat, thermal conductivity, viscosity, and specific gas constant depend on one or two thermodynamic variables. Our approach models a mixture of perfect gases in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The gas properties are provided either by means of direct calls to a library based on statistical mechanics and kinetic theory or indirectly in the form of look-up tables. In the first part of the paper, our method of handling a high-temperature gas in thermochemical equilibrium is described and verified. In the second part, the method is applied to the investigation of linear and non-linear boundary-layer instability. We carry out numerical simulations for a laminar flat-plate boundary layer at Mach 10 with a small, convectively amplified perturbation for both Earth and Martian atmospheres. Amplification of the perturbations shows favorable agreement with results obtained from linear theory. The secondary instability of the boundary layer in the presence of a large-amplitude two-dimensional wave is investigated. We observe that the non-linear mechanism of fundamental resonance becomes active and leads to a strong increase in amplification of three-dimensional disturbance waves. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

Both a frozen gas and a finite-rate chemically reacting gas are considered. The weakly nonlinear instability in the presence of a large-amplitude two-dimensional wave is investigated for the case of fundamental resonance. Depending on the amplitude of this two-dimensional primary wave, strong growth of oblique secondary perturbations occurs for favourable relative phase differences between the two. For essentially the same primary amplitude, secondary amplification is almost identical for a reacting and a frozen gas. Therefore, chemical reactions do not directly affect the growth of secondary perturbations, but only indirectly through the change of linear instability and hence amplitude of the primary wave. When the secondary disturbances reach a sufficiently large amplitude, strongly nonlinear effects stabilize both primary and secondary perturbations. © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

   abstract = {A new numerical method is presented here that allows to consider chemically reacting gases during the direct numerical simulation of a hypersonic fluid flow. The method comprises the direct coupling of a solver for the fluid mechanical model and a library providing the physio-chemical model. The numerical method for the fluid mechanical model integrates the compressible Navier-Stokes equations using an explicit time advancement scheme and high-order finite differences. This Navier-Stokes code can be applied to the investigation of laminar-turbulent transition and boundary-layer instability. The numerical method for the physio-chemical model provides thermodynamic and transport properties for different gases as well as chemical production rates, while here we exclusively consider a five species air mixture. The new method is verified for a number of test cases at Mach 10, including the one-dimensional high-temperature flow downstream of a normal shock, a hypersonic chemical reacting boundary layer in local thermodynamic equilibrium and a hypersonic reacting boundary layer with finite-rate chemistry. We are able to confirm that the diffusion flux plays an important role for a high-temperature boundary layer in local thermodynamic equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the flow for a case previously considered as a benchmark for the investigation of non-equilibrium chemistry can be regarded as frozen. Finally, the new method is applied to investigate the effect of finite-rate chemistry on boundary layer instability by considering the downstream evolution of a small-amplitude wave and comparing results with those obtained for a frozen gas as well as a gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In the model, one temperature (T) is assumed to characterize the heavy-particle translational and molecular rotational energies, and another temperature (Tv) the molecular vibrational, electron translational, and electronic excitation energies. The theoretical results for nonequilibrium flow in shock tubes are obtained using the computer code STRAP (shock-tube radiation program) and for flow along the stagnation streamline in the shock layer over spherical bodies using the newly developed code SPRAP (stagnation-point radiation program). Substantial agreement is shown between the theoretical and experimental results for relaxation times and radiative heat fluxes. At very high temperatures, the spectral calculations need further improvement. The present agreement provides strong evidence that the two-temperature model characterizes principal features of nonequilibriumairflow. New theoretical results using the model are presented for the radiative heat fluxes at the stagnation point of 6 m radius sphere, representing an aeroassisted orbital transfer vehicle, over a range of freestream conditions.

   abstract = {The predictive capabilities of turbulent flow simulations, critical for aerodynamic design and weather prediction, hinge on the choice of turbulence models. The abundance of data from experiments and simulations and the advent of machine learning have provided a boost to these modeling efforts. However, simulations of turbulent flows remain hindered by the inability of heuristics and supervised learning to model the near-wall dynamics. We address this challenge by introducing scientific multi-agent reinforcement learning (SciMARL) for the discovery of wall models for large-eddy simulations (LES). In SciMARL, discretization points act also as cooperating agents that learn to supply the LES closure model. The agents self-learn using limited data and generalize to extreme Reynolds numbers and previously unseen geometries. The present simulations reduce by several orders of magnitude the computational cost over fully-resolved simulations while reproducing key flow quantities. We believe that SciMARL creates new capabilities for the simulation of turbulent flows.},

Our aim is to understand how the term “turbulence” introduced by William Thomson in 1887, which was not used by the main researchers of the time, including Joseph Boussinesq, Osborne Reynolds, Lord Rayleigh, Horace Lamb in the first editions of his book, became classical in the 1920s. We trace the first introductions of the terms “turbulence”, “turbulent flow” in the works of relatively unknown researchers between 1889 and 1903, until it reaches the vocabulary of mainstream researchers in fluid mechanics and physics. Our result is that the shift was in 1906–1908, when the term was used in the 1906 edition of the book of Horace Lamb, and in Lanchester's book, followed by a series of papers of German researchers before the First World War. The use of the word “turbulence”, a word used for a long time for crowds or for children, in a scientific context, corresponds to the introduction of a new concept, a new understanding of a scientific phenomenon clearly identified as being different from laminar motion. The study of the use of this term is also the study of the diffusion of a new concept among researchers of the time.},

Models for all these terms are proposed: a similarity model for the pressure-dilatation, similarity and k-dependent models for the turbulent dissipation rate and a dynamic mixed model for the pressure-velocity subgrid-term. Actual LES demonstrates that for a low Mach number all subgrid-terms in the energy equation can be neglected, while for a moderate Mach number the effect of the modelled turbulent dissipation rate is larger than the combined effect of the other modelled subgrid-terms in the filtered energy equation. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

In particular the magnitude of all subgrid-terms, the role of the discretization errors and the correlation of the turbulent stress tensor with several subgrid-models are studied. The basis of the investigation is a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the two- and three-dimensional compressible mixing layer, using a finite volume method on a sufficiently fine grid. With respect to the first aspect, the exact filtered Navier-Stokes equations are derived and all terms are classified according to their order of magnitude. It is found that the pressure dilatation subgrid-term in the filtered energy equation, which is usually neglected in the modelling-practice, is as large as e.g. the pressure velocity subgrid-term, which in general is modelled. The second aspect yields the result that second- and fourth-order accurate spatial discretization methods give rise to discretization errors which are larger than the corresponding subgrid-terms, if the ratio between the filter width and the grid-spacing is close to one. Even if an exact representation for the subgrid-scale contributions is assumed, LES performed on a (considerably) coarser grid than required for a DNS, is accurate only if this ratio is sufficiently larger than one. Finally the well-known turbulent stress tensor is investigated in more detail. A priori tests of subgrid-models for this tensor yield poor correlations for Smagorinsky's model, which is purely dissipative, while the non-eddy viscosity models considered here correlate considerably better. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

The inviscid fluxes are determined by Godunov's second method or Roe's method. Two different second-order accurate function reconstruction techniques have been evaluated. The subgrid scale stresses are computed using a second-order accurate method based on Gauss' theorem. A second-order Runge-Kutta method is employed for the temporal integration.

   abstract = {There exists significant demand for improved Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence models that are informed by and can represent a richer set of turbulence physics. This paper presents a method of using deep neural networks to learn a model for the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor from high-fidelity simulation data. A novel neural network architecture is proposed which uses a multiplicative layer with an invariant tensor basis to embed Galilean invariance into the predicted anisotropy tensor. It is demonstrated that this neural network architecture provides improved prediction accuracy compared with a generic neural network architecture that does not embed this invariance property. The Reynolds stress anisotropy predictions of this invariant neural network are propagated through to the velocity field for two test cases. For both test cases, significant improvement versus baseline RANS linear eddy viscosity and nonlinear eddy viscosity models is demonstrated.},

   abstract = {In this investigation, a data-driven turbulence closure framework is introduced and deployed for the subgrid modelling of Kraichnan turbulence. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the fact that snapshots from high-fidelity numerical data are used to inform artificial neural networks for predicting the turbulence source term through localized grid-resolved information. In particular, our proposed methodology successfully establishes a map between inputs given by stencils of the vorticity and the streamfunction along with information from two well-known eddy-viscosity kernels. Through this we predict the subgrid vorticity forcing in a temporally and spatially dynamic fashion. Our study is both a priori and a posteriori in nature. In the former, we present an extensive hyper-parameter optimization analysis in addition to learning quantification through probability-density-function-based validation of subgrid predictions. In the latter, we analyse the performance of our framework for flow evolution in a classical decaying two-dimensional turbulence test case in the presence of errors related to temporal and spatial discretization. Statistical assessments in the form of angle-averaged kinetic energy spectra demonstrate the promise of the proposed methodology for subgrid quantity inference. In addition, it is also observed that some measure of a posteriori error must be considered during optimal model selection for greater accuracy. The results in this article thus represent a promising development in the formalization of a framework for generation of heuristic-free turbulence closures from data.},

   abstract = {In the literature, anisotropy-invariant maps are being proposed to represent a domain within which all realizable Reynolds stress invariants must lie. It is shown that the representation proposed by Lumley and Newman has disadvantages owing to the fact that the anisotropy invariants (II, III) are nonlinear functions of stresses. In the current work, it is proposed to use an equivalent linear representation of the anisotropy invariants in terms of eigenvalues. A novel barycentric map, based on the convex combination of scalar metrics dependent on eigenvalues, is proposed to provide a non-distorted visual representation of anisotropy in turbulent quantities. This barycentric map provides the possibility of viewing the Reynolds stress and any anisotropic stress tensor. Additionally the barycentric map provides the possibility of quantifying the weighting for any point inside it in terms of the limiting states (one component, two component, three component). The mathematical basis for the barycentric map is derived using the spectral decomposition theorem for second-order tensors. In this way, an analytical proof is provided that All turbulence lies along the boundaries or inside the barycentric map. It is proved that the barycentric map and the anisotropy-invariant maps are one to one uniquely interdependent and as a result satisfy the requirement of realizability.},

@article{Jimenez2018,
   abstract = {This article discusses the description of wall-bounded turbulence as a deterministic high-dimensional dynamical system of interacting coherent structures, defined as eddies with enough internal dynamics to behave relatively autonomously from any remaining incoherent part of the flow. The guiding principle is that randomness is not a property, but a methodological choice of what to ignore in the flow, and that a complete understanding of turbulence, including the possibility of control, requires that it be kept to a minimum. After briefly reviewing the underlying low-order statistics of flows at moderate Reynolds numbers, the article examines what two-point statistics imply for the decomposition of the flow into individual eddies. Intense eddies are examined next, including their temporal evolution, and shown to satisfy many of the properties required for coherence. In particular, it is shown that coherent structures larger than the Corrsin scale are a natural consequence of the shear. In wall-bounded turbulence, they can be classified into coherent dispersive waves and transient bursts. The former are found in the viscous layer near the wall, and as very large structures spanning the entire boundary layer. Although they are shear-driven, these waves have enough internal structure to maintain a uniform advection velocity. Conversely, bursts exist at all scales, are characteristic of the logarithmic layer, and interact almost linearly with the shear. While the waves require a wall to determine their length scale, the bursts are essentially independent from it. The article concludes with a brief review of our present theoretical understanding of turbulent structures, and with a list of open problems and future perspectives. ‘Chance is the name we give to what we choose to ignore (Voltaire)’},

   abstract = {Multifractal subgrid-scalemodeling embedded into a variational multiscalemethod is proposed for large-eddy simulation of passive-scalar mixing in turbulent incompressible flow. In this subgrid-scale modeling approach, subgrid-scale velocity and scalar field are directly approximated by amultifractal reconstruction process replicating the actual physics of turbulent flows. Problems from low to high Schmidt numbers (i.e., Sc ≈ 1 to Sc > 1) are considered in this work. Starting from preceding work, in this study, multifractal subgrid-scale modeling is further detailed by refining the approximation processwithin the scalar field. Thereby, appropriate multifractal subgrid-scale modeling for passive-scalar mixing is derived in comprehensive form for the entire range of Schmidt numbers. The near-wall behavior of the multifractal subgrid-scale modeling approach is investigated for wall-bounded turbulent flows with passivescalar mixing. The method is validated for passive-scalar mixing in turbulent channel flow for a broad range of Schmidt numbers in between 1 and 1000. Excellent performance is stated for all Schmidt numbers, in particular when comparing the results obtained with the proposed method to results provided by other methods widely used in the literature. An analysis of the subgrid-scale scalar-variance transfer highlights the influence of the multifractal subgrid-scale modeling within the variational multiscale method. The near-wall behavior of the proposed method is investigated via the transfer coefficient, for which results consistent with the theoretical correlation are obtained. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

   abstract = {The modelling of the pressure-strain correlation of turbulence is examined from a basic theoretical standpoint with a view toward developing improved second-order closure models. Invariance considerations along with elementary dynamical systems theory are used in the analysis of the standard hierarchy of closure models. In these commonly used models, the pressure-strain correlation is assumed to be a linear function of the mean velocity gradients with coefficients that depend algebraically on the anisotropy tensor. It is proven that for plane homogeneous turbulent flows the equilibrium structure of this hierarchy of models is encapsulated by a relatively simple model which is only quadratically nonlinear in the anisotropy tensor. This new quadratic model - the SSG model - appears to yield improved results over the Launder, Reece &amp; Rodi model (as well as more recent models that have a considerably more complex nonlinear structure) in five independent homogeneous turbulent flows. However, some deficiencies still remain for the description of rotating turbulent shear flows that are intrinsic to this general hierarchy of models and, hence, cannot be overcome by the mere introduction of more complex nonlinearities. It is thus argued that the recent trend of adding substantially more complex nonlinear terms containing the anisotropy tensor may be of questionable value in the modelling of the pressure–strain correlation. Possible alternative approaches are discussed briefly.},

   abstract = {The intermittency of the rate of turbulent energy dissipation ε is investigated experimentally, with special emphasis on its scale-similar facets. This is done using a general formulation in terms of multifractals, and by interpreting measurements in that light. The concept of multiplicative processes in turbulence is (heuristically) shown to lead to multifractal distributions, whose formalism is described in some detail. To prepare proper ground for the interpretation of experimental results, a variety of cascade models is reviewed and their physical contents are analysed qualitatively. Point-probe measurements of ε are made in several laboratory flows and in the atmospheric surface layer, using Taylor's frozen-flow hypothesis. The multifractal spectrum f (α) of ε is measured using different averaging techniques, and the results are shown to be in essential agreement among themselves and with our earlier ones. Also, long data sets obtained in two laboratory flows are used to obtain the latent part of the f (α) curve, confirming Mandelbrot's idea that it can in principle be obtained from linear cuts through a three-dimensional distribution. The tails of distributions of box-averaged dissipation are found to be of the square-root exponential type, and the implications of this finding for the f (α) distribution are discussed. A comparison of the results to a variety of cascade models shows that binomial models give the simplest possible mechanism that reproduces most of the observations. Generalizations to multinomial models are discussed.},

   abstract = {Earlier experimental assessments of fractal scale similarity in geometric properties of turbulent flows are extended to assess the applicability of multifractal scale-similarity in the conserved scalar field ζ( x , t ) and in the true scalar energy dissipation rate field ∇ζ·∇ζ( x , t ). Fully resolved four-dimensional spatio-temporal measurements from a turbulent flow at Re λ ≈41 and Re δ ≈3000 are analysed. The utility of various classical constructs for identifying multifractal scale similarity in data records of finite length is examined. An objective statistical criterion based on the maximum allowable scale-to-scale variation L 1 (ε) in multiplier distributions 〈 P ( M ε )〉 obtained from multifractal gauge fields is developed to allow accurate discrimination between multifractal and non-multifractal scaling in finite-length experimental data records. Results from analyses of temporal intersections show that for scales greater than 0.03 λ ν / u , corresponding to 1.4 λ D / u , the scalar dissipation field clearly demonstrates a scale-invariant similarity consistent with a multiplicative cascade process that can be modelled with a bilinear multiplier distribution. However, the conserved scalar field from precisely the same data does not follow any scale similarity consistent with a multiplicative cascade at scales below 0.5 λ ν / u . At larger scales, there are indications of a possible scale-invariant similarity in the scalar field, but with a fundamentally different multiplier distribution.},

   abstract = {Experimental results are presented for the influence of Reynolds number on multifractal scale similarity in turbulent flows. These are obtained from single-point measurements of a dynamically passive Sc ≈1 conserved scalar quantity ζ( t ) in a turbulent shear flow at outer-scale Reynolds numbers of 14000[les ] Re δ [les ]110000. Statistical criteria based on the maximum allowable scale-to-scale variation L 1 (ε) in multiplier distributions P ( M ε ) from multifractal gauge sets allow accurate discrimination between multifractal and non-multifractal scaling. Results show that the surrogate scalar energy dissipation rate χ s ( t )≡(dζ/d t ) 2 is found to display a scale-invariant similarity consistent with a random multiplicative cascade characterized by a bilinear multiplier distribution P ( M ε ) over a range of scales extending downward from the outer scale T δ . For a range of scales extending upward from the inner (diffusive) scale T D , the dissipation rate displays a different scale-invariant similarity characterized by a uniform multiplier distribution. The former scale-invariance becomes evident in the present Sc ≈1 data only when Re δ is sufficiently large. Comparisons with results from Sc 1 data indicate that this scale-invariant similarity applies when the outer-to-inner scale ratio T δ / T D ≈0.09 Re 3/4 δ Sc 1/2 is greater than about 400. In contrast to the scalar dissipation rate field, the scalar field is found to lack any multifractal scale similarity.},

   abstract = {Speculations abound that several facets of fully developed turbulent flows are fractals. Although the earlier leading work of Mandelbrot (1974, 1975) suggests that these speculations, initiated largely by himself, are plausible, no effort has yet been made to put them on firmer ground by, resorting to actual measurements in turbulent shear flows. This work is an attempt at filling this gap. In particular, we examine the following questions: ( a ) Is the turbulent/non-turbulent interface a self-similar fractal, and (if so) what is its fractal dimension ? Does this quantity differ from one class of flows to another? ( b ) Are constant-property surfaces (such as the iso-velocity and iso-concentration surfaces) in fully developed flows fractals? What are their fractal dimensions? ( c ) Do dissipative structures in fully developed turbulence form a fractal set? What is the fractal dimension of this set? Answers to these questions (and others to be less fully discussed here) are interesting because they bring the theory of fractals closer to application to turbulence and shed new light on some classical problems in turbulence - for example, the growth of material lines in a turbulent environment. The other feature of this work is that it tries to quantify the seemingly complicated geometric aspects of turbulent flows, a feature that has not received its proper share of attention. The overwhelming conclusion of this work is that several aspects of turbulence can be described roughly by fractals, and that their fractal dimensions can be measured. However, it is not clear how (or whether), given the dimensions for several of its facets, one can solve (up to a useful accuracy) the inverse problem of reconstructing the original set (that is, the turbulent flow itself).},

   abstract = {Abstract. This paper gives a review of some recent work on intermittency, non-Gaussian statistics, and fractal scaling of solar wind magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Model calculations and theories are discussed and put in their context with the in-situ observations of the solar wind fluctuations, essentially of the flow velocity and magnetic field. Emphasis is placed more on a comparison of the data with the theory than on a complete derivation of the model results, which are treated in a more tutorial fashion. The introduction reminds of some important observations and key aspects of the solar wind turbulence. Then structure functions are defined and observational results discussed. The probability density functions provide a direct means to analyse the statistical properties of the fluctuations. Evidence for non-Gaussian statistics is provided. Intermittency and simple scaling models are discussed, which yield algebraic expressions for the scaling exponents of the structure functions. The concept of the extended self-similarity is presented and corresponding observational evidence for its existence in the solar wind is provided. Subsequently, and extended structure function model, including the p-model scaling and a scale-dependent cascade, is discussed and compared with selected measurements. The basics of the multifractals are presented and applied to solar wind data. The multifractal scaling of the kinetic energy flux as proxy for the unknown cascading rate is established observationally, and the so-called multifractal spectrum is obtained. Finally, the scaling exponents of the associated correlation functions are derived and analysed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the empirical results and prospects for the future research in this field and in solar wind MHD turbulence in general.},

   abstract = {This article reviews the main established ideas on the influence of a magnetic field on turbulence in electrically conducting fluids. We limit our discussion to the asymptotic range of very small values of the magnetic Reynolds number, characterized by the fact that the induced magnetic field remains very small in comparison with the applied magnetic field. We consider three kinds of flows here. The simplest one is freely decaying homogeneous turbulence, which serves as a test bed to analyze the development of anisotropy resulting from the linear damping by the Lorentz force. We then discuss flows between walls perpendicular to the magnetic field and emphasize the influence of the Hartmann layers that develop in their vicinity. We then review the main features of the possible quasi-two-dimensional regime that can arise in that context. Finally, we consider magnetohydrodynamic turbulent shear flows. These are frequent in industrial applications involving molten metals, such as in metal processing or in the blanket of future nuclear fusion reactors. We pay particular attention to recent attempts to develop specific RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) models for these flows.},

   abstract = {Results are presented from an experimental study into the fine-scale structure of generic, Sc ≈1, dynamically passive, conserved scalar fields in turbulent shear flows. The investigation was based on highly resolved, two-dimensional imaging of laser Rayleigh scattering, with measurements obtained in the self-similar far field of an axisymmetric coflowing turbulent jet of propane issuing into air at local outer-scale Reynolds numbers Re δ ≡ u δ/ v of 11000 and 14000. The resolution and signal quality of these measurements allowed direct differentiation of the scalar field data ζ( x , t ) to determine the instantaneous scalar energy dissipation rate field ( Re Sc ) −1 ∇ζ·∇ζ( x , t ). Results show that, as for large- Sc scalars (Buch & Dahm 1996), the scalar dissipation rate field consists entirely of strained, laminar, sheet-like diffusion layers, despite the fact that at Sc ≈1 the scale on which these layers are folded by vorticity gradients is comparable to the layer thickness. Good agreement is found between the measured internal structure of these layers and the self-similar local solution of the scalar transport equation for a spatially uniform but time-varying strain field. The self-similar distribution of dissipation layer thicknesses shows that the ratio of maximum to minimum thicknesses is only 3 at these conditions. The local dissipation layer thickness is related to the local outer scale as λ D /δ ≡ ΛRe −3/4 δ Sc −1/2 , with the average thickness found to be 〈 Λ 〉=11.2, with both the largest and smallest layer thicknesses following Kolmogorov Re −3/4 δ ) scaling.},

   abstract = {We report results from direct numerical simulation (DNS) of stationary compressible isotropic turbulence at very-high resolutions and a range of parameters using a massively parallel code at Taylor Reynolds numbers ( $R_\{\{\it\lambda\}\}$ ) ranging from $R_\{\{\it\lambda\}\}=38$ to $430$ and turbulent Mach numbers ( $M_\{t\}$ ) ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 on up to $2048^\{3\}$ grid resolutions. A stationary state is maintained by a stochastic solenoidal forcing at the largest scales. The focus is on the mechanisms of energy exchanges, namely, dissipation, pressure-dilatation correlation and the individual contributing variables. Compressibility effects are studied by decomposing velocity and pressure fields into solenoidal and dilatational components. We suggest a critical turbulent Mach number at about 0.3 that separate two different flow regimes – only at Mach numbers above this critical value do we observe dilatational effects to affect the flow behaviour in a qualitative manner. The equipartition of energy between the dilatational components of kinetic and potential energy, originally proposed for decaying flows at low $M_\{t\}$ , presents significant scatter at low $M_\{t\}$ , but appears to be valid at high $M_\{t\}$ for stationary flows, which is explained by the different role of dilatational pressure in decaying and stationary flows, and at low and high $M_\{t\}$ . While at low $M_\{t\}$ pressure possesses characteristics of solenoidal pressure, at high $M_\{t\}$ it behaves in similar ways to dilatational pressure, which results in significant changes in the dynamics of energy exchanges. This also helps explain the observed qualitative change in the skewness of pressure at high $M_\{t\}$ reported in the literature. Regions of high pressure are found to be correlated with regions of intense local expansions. In these regions, the density–temperature correlation is also seen to be relatively high. Classical scaling laws for low-order moments originally proposed for incompressible turbulence appear to be only weakly affected by compressibility for the range of $R_\{\{\it\lambda\}\}$ and $M_\{t\}$ investigated.},

   abstract = {The effect of wall temperature on the transfer of kinetic energy in a hypersonic turbulent boundary layer for different Mach numbers and wall temperature ratios is studied by direct numerical simulation. A cold wall temperature can enhance the compressibility effect in the near-wall region through increasing the temperature gradient and wall heat flux. It is shown that the cold wall temperature enhances the local reverse transfer of kinetic energy from small scales to large scales, and suppresses the local direct transfer of kinetic energy from large scales to small scales. The average filtered spatial convection and average filtered viscous dissipation are dominant in the near-wall region, while the average subgrid-scale flux of kinetic energy achieves its peak value in the buffer layer. It is found that the wall can suppress the inter-scale transfer of kinetic energy, especially for the situation of a cold wall. A strong local reverse transfer of fluctuating kinetic energy is identified in the buffer layer in the inertial range. Helmholtz decomposition is applied to analyse the compressibility effect on the subgrid-scale flux of kinetic energy. A strong transfer of the solenoidal component of fluctuating kinetic energy is identified in the buffer layer, while a significant transfer of the dilatational component of fluctuating kinetic energy is observed in the near-wall region. It is also shown that compression motions have a major contribution to the direct transfer of fluctuating kinetic energy, while expansion motions play a marked role in the reverse transfer of fluctuating kinetic energy.},

   abstract = {We study the structure of high-speed zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers up to friction Reynolds number $Re_\{\tau \} \approx 2000$ using direct numerical simulation of the Navier–Stokes equations. Both supersonic and hypersonic conditions with nominal free-stream Mach numbers $M_\{\infty \}=2$ , $M_\{\infty \}=5.86$ and heat transfer at the wall are considered. The present simulations extend the database currently available for wall-bounded flows, enabling us to explore high-Reynolds-number effects even in the hypersonic regime. We first analyse the instantaneous fields to characterize the structure of both velocity and temperature fluctuations. In all cases elongated strips of uniform velocity and temperature (superstructures) are observed in the outer portion of the boundary layer, characterized by a clear association between low-/high-speed momentum and high/low temperature streaks. The results highlight important deviations from the typical organization observed in the inner region of adiabatic boundary layers, revealing that the near-wall temperature streaks disappear in strongly non-adiabatic flow cases. We also focus on the structural properties of regions of uniform streamwise momentum (De Silva, Hutchins & Marusic, J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 786, 2016, pp. 309–331) observed in turbulent boundary layers, confirming the presence of such zones in the high-speed regime at high Reynolds number and revealing the existence of similar regions for the temperature field. The accuracy of different compressibility transformations and temperature–velocity relations is assessed extending their range of validation to moderate/high Reynolds numbers. Spanwise spectral densities of the velocity and temperature fluctuations at various wall distances have been calculated revealing the energy content and the size of the turbulent eddies across the boundary layer. Finally, we propose a revised scaling for the characteristic length scales, that is based on the local mean shear computed according to the recent theory by Griffin, Fu & Moin [ Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA , vol. 118 (34)].},

It is apparent that the approach to an asymptotically high–Reynolds number state is slow, but at a sufficiently high Reynolds number the log law remains a fundamental part of the mean flow description. With regard to the coherent motions, very-large-scale motions or superstructures exist at all Reynolds numbers, but they become increasingly important with Reynolds number in terms of their energy content and their interaction with the smaller scales near the wall. There is accumulating evidence that certain features are flow specific, such as the constants in the log law and the behavior of the very large scales and their interaction with the large scales (consisting of vortex packets). Moreover, the refined attached-eddy hypothesis continues to provide an important theoretical framework for the structure of wall-bounded turbulent flows.},

   abstract = {It is shown that the dilatational terms that need to be modelled in compressible turbulence include not only the pressure-dilatation term but also another term - the compressible dissipation. The nature of the compressible velocity field, which generates these dilatational terms, is explored by asymptotic analysis of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the case of homogeneous turbulence. The lowest-order equations for the compressible field are solved and explicit expressions for some of the associated one-point moments are obtained. For low Mach numbers, the compressible mode has a fast timescale relative to the incompressible mode. Therefore, it is proposed that, in moderate Mach number homogeneous turbulence, the compressible component of the turbulence is in quasi-equilibrium with respect to the incompressible turbulence. A non-dimensional parameter which characterizes this equilibrium structure of the compressible mode is identified. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of isotropic, compressible turbulence are performed, and their results are found to be in agreement with the theoretical analysis. A model for the compressible dissipation is proposed; the model is based on the asymptotic analysis and the direct numerical simulations. This model is calibrated with reference to the DNS results regarding the influence of compressibility on the decay rate of isotropic turbulence. An application of the proposed model to the compressible mixing layer has shown that the model is able to predict the dramatically reduced growth rate of the compressible mixing layer.},

For high-speed compressible flows, due to the wall-normal variations of density and viscosity, it has not been established how to transform a dimensional velocity profile into a universal profile. We propose a transformation that is more accurate and more broadly applicable than existing approaches. This improvement results from deploying different physical arguments for the two critical subdomains of a boundary layer. The transformation can be used to extend incompressible turbulence models to compressible turbulent flows, such as those encountered by vehicles for high-speed transportation and planetary reentry.},

   abstract = {We demonstrate that data from direct numerical simulation of turbulent boundary layers at Mach 3 exhibit the same large-scale coherent structures that are found in supersonic and subsonic experiments, namely elongated, low-speed features in the logarithmic region and hairpin vortex packets. Contour plots of the streamwise mass flux show very long low-momentum structures in the logarithmic layer. These low-momentum features carry about one-third of the turbulent kinetic energy. Using Taylor's hypothesis, we find that these structures prevail and meander for very long streamwise distances. Structure lengths on the order of 100 boundary layer thicknesses are observed. Length scales obtained from correlations of the streamwise mass flux severely underpredict the extent of these structures, most likely because of their significant meandering in the spanwise direction. A hairpin-packet-finding algorithm is employed to determine the average packet properties, and we find that the Mach 3 packets are similar to those observed at subsonic conditions. A connection between the wall shear stress and hairpin packets is observed. Visualization of the instantaneous turbulence structure shows that groups of hairpin packets are frequently located above the long low-momentum structures.

   abstract = {In this paper we present direct numerical simulations (DNS) of hypersonic turbulent boundary layers to study high-enthalpy effects. We study high- and low-enthalpy conditions, which are representative of those in hypersonic flight and ground-based facilities, respectively. We find that high-enthalpy boundary layers closely resemble those at low enthalpy. Many of the scaling relations for low-enthalpy flows, such as van-Driest transformation for the mean velocity, Morkovin’s scaling and the modified strong Reynolds analogy hold or can be generalized for high-enthalpy flows by removing the calorically perfect-gas assumption. We propose a generalized form of the modified Crocco relation, which relates the mean temperature and mean velocity across a wide range of conditions, including non-adiabatic cold walls and real gas effects. The DNS data predict Reynolds analogy factors in the range of those found in experimental data at low-enthalpy conditions. The gradient transport model approximately holds with turbulent Prandtl number and turbulent Schmidt number of order unity. Direct compressibility effects remain small and insignificant for all enthalpy cases. High-enthalpy effects have no sizable influence on turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budgets or on the turbulence structure.},

The influence of wall cooling on Morkovin's scaling, Walz's equation, the standard and modified strong Reynolds analogies, turbulent kinetic energy budgets, compressibility effects and near-wall coherent structures is assessed. We find that many of the scaling relations used to express adiabatic compressible boundary-layer statistics in terms of incompressible boundary layers also hold for non-adiabatic cases. Compressibility effects are enhanced by wall cooling but remain insignificant, and the turbulence dissipation remains primarily solenoidal. Moreover, the variation of near-wall streaks, iso-surface of the swirl strength and hairpin packets with wall temperature demonstrates that cooling the wall increases the coherency of turbulent structures. We present the mechanism by which wall cooling enhances the coherence of turbulence structures, and we provide an explanation of why this mechanism does not represent an exception to the weakly compressible hypothesis.},

We find that many of the scaling relations, such as the van Driest transformation for mean velocity, Walz's relation, Morkovin's scaling and the strong Reynolds analogy, which are derived based on the weak compressibility hypothesis, remain valid for the range of free-stream Mach numbers considered. The explicit dilatation terms such as pressure dilatation and dilatational dissipation remain small for the present Mach number range, and the pressure–strain correlation and the anisotropy of the Reynolds stress tensor are insensitive to the free-stream Mach number. The possible effects of intrinsic compressibility are reflected by the increase in the fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities ( p ′ rms / p w , ρ′ rms / ρ , T ′ rms / T ) and turbulence Mach numbers ( M t , M ′ rms ), the existence of shocklets, the modification of turbulence structures (near-wall streaks and large-scale motions) and the variation in the onset of intermittency.},

@article{Bae2019,
   abstract = {Wall modelling in large-eddy simulation (LES) is necessary to overcome the prohibitive near-wall resolution requirements in high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows. Most existing wall models rely on assumptions about the state of the boundary layer and require a priori prescription of tunable coefficients. They also impose the predicted wall stress by replacing the no-slip boundary condition at the wall with a Neumann boundary condition in the wall-parallel directions while maintaining the no-transpiration condition in the wall-normal direction. In the present study, we first motivate and analyse the Robin (slip) boundary condition with transpiration (non-zero wall-normal velocity) in the context of wall-modelled LES. The effect of the slip boundary condition on the one-point statistics of the flow is investigated in LES of turbulent channel flow and a flat-plate turbulent boundary layer. It is shown that the slip condition provides a framework to compensate for the deficit or excess of mean momentum at the wall. Moreover, the resulting non-zero stress at the wall alleviates the well-known problem of the wall-stress under-estimation by current subgrid-scale (SGS) models (Jiménez & Moser, AIAA J. , vol. 38 (4), 2000, pp. 605–612). Second, we discuss the requirements for the slip condition to be used in conjunction with wall models and derive the equation that connects the slip boundary condition with the stress at the wall. Finally, a dynamic procedure for the slip coefficients is formulated, providing a dynamic slip wall model free of a priori specified coefficients. The performance of the proposed dynamic wall model is tested in a series of LES of turbulent channel flow at varying Reynolds numbers, non-equilibrium three-dimensional transient channel flow and a zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate turbulent boundary layer. The results show that the dynamic wall model is able to accurately predict one-point turbulence statistics for various flow configurations, Reynolds numbers and grid resolutions.},

Fluids20, 035103 (2008)] is employed in the first numerical study of multimode miscible Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in the ultrahigh Atwood-number regime above A≥0.90. The present work focuses on the dynamics of turbulent mixing at the large density ratios that may be encountered in certain astrophysical contexts and engineering applications. Using the initial condition from the landmark (N=30723) direct numerical study of Cabot and Cook [W. Cabot and A. W. Cook, "Transition stages of Rayleigh-Taylor instability between miscible fluids," Nat. Phys.2, 562 (2006)], the nLES method is first validated in simulations of A=0.5 RTI mixing and is shown to recover important statistical measures of the mixing process, such as bubble and spike growth rates and mixing efficiency reported in that study, but at the significantly coarser resolutions typical of most large-eddy simulations. The first simulations of RTI at Atwood numbers A>0.90 are then used to explore the effects of varying the density ratio on mixing dynamics at very high Atwood numbers 0.75≤A≤0.96. Spike heights and mixing layer growth rates are shown to be strongly affected by the initial density ratio. An empirical power-law scaling relationship is shown to predict nearly exactly the variation in the ratio of spike to bubble heights as a function of Atwood number. Mixing efficiency is shown to be influenced by the initial density difference but the competition between increased molecular mixing and entrainment largely cancel, producing a relatively modest variation in these flow parameters when compared with the intermediate Atwood-number case. Late-time power spectra show the appearance of an inertial range, indicating that the mixing layer has transitioned to a fully turbulent state. The role of bubble and spike structures in the interscale transfer of kinetic energy is explored for the first time for high Atwood-number RTI flows. Bubble heads (stems) are shown to produce forward (reverse) transfer due to compressive (extensional) straining at intermediate Atwood number. At high Atwood number, however, spike stems are shown to produce forward transfer due to compressive straining generated from the larger spike penetration velocity and the differing spike morphology produced at the higher Atwood number. The study indicates that stable and accurate simulations of ultrahigh Atwood-number mixing may be conducted using the nLES method on grids significantly coarser than used previously to examine RTI flows. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

Small-perturbation analysis is used to study the scaling of variances, and different cross-correlations as well as spectra. Qualitative differences are observed between low and high $\{M\}_\{t\} $ . The probability density functions (p.d.f.s) of pressure and density are negatively skewed at low $\{M\}_\{t\} $ (consistent with incompressible results) but become positively skewed at high $\{M\}_\{t\} $ . The positive tails are found to follow a log-normal distribution. A new variable is introduced to quantify departures from isentropic fluctuations (an assumption commonly used in the literature) and is found to increase as $\{ M\}_\{t\}^\{2\} $ . However, positive fluctuations of pressure and density tend to be more isentropic than negative fluctuations. In general, Reynolds number effects on single-point statistics are observed to be weak. The spectral behaviour of pressure, density and temperature is also investigated. While at low $\{M\}_\{t\} $ , pressure appears to scale as $\{k\}^\{- 7/ 3\} $ ( $k$ is the wavenumber) in the inertial range as in incompressible flows, a $\{k\}^\{- 5/ 3\} $ scaling also appears to be consistent with the data at a range of Mach numbers.

   abstract = {Results are presented from a new approach to modeling the subgrid-scale stresses in large-eddy simulation of turbulent flows, based on explicit evaluation of the subgrid velocity components from a multifractal representation of the subgrid vorticity field. The approach is motivated by prior studies showing that the enstrophy field exhibits multifractal scale-similarity on inertial-range scales in high Reynolds number turbulence. A scale-invariant multiplicative cascade thus gives the spatial distribution of subgrid vorticity magnitudes within each resolved-scale cell, and an additive cascade gives the progressively isotropic decorrelation of subgrid vorticity orientations from the resolved scale Δ to the viscous scale λν. The subgrid velocities are then obtained from Biot-Savart integrals over this subgrid vorticity field. The resulting subgrid velocity components become simple algebraic expressions in terms of resolved-scale quantities, which then allow explicit evaluation of the subgrid stresses τij*. This new multifractal subgrid-scale model is shown in a priori tests to give good agreement for the filtered subgrid velocities, the subgrid stress components, and the subgrid energy production at both low (ReΔ; ≈ 160) and high (ReΔ; ≈ 2550) resolved-scale Reynolds numbers. Implementing the model is no more computationally burdensome than traditional eddy-viscosity models. Moreover, evaluation of the subgrid stresses requires no explicit differentiation of the resolved velocity field and is therefore comparatively unaffected by discretization errors. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

The abundance of data from experiments and simulations and the advent of machine learning have provided a boost to turbulence modeling efforts. However, simulations of turbulent flows remain hindered by the inability of heuristics and supervised learning to model the near-wall dynamics. We address this challenge by introducing scientific multi-agent reinforcement learning (SciMARL) for the discovery of wall models for large-eddy simulations (LES). In SciMARL, discretization points act also as cooperating agents that learn to supply the LES closure model. The agents self-learn using limited data and generalize to extreme Reynolds numbers and previously unseen geometries. The present simulations reduce by several orders of magnitude the computational cost over fully-resolved simulations while reproducing key flow quantities. We believe that SciMARL creates unprecedented capabilities for the simulation of turbulent flows.},

Further, the paper discusses how the software architecture has been designed to ensure modularity, incorporating the ability to introduce additional models in an efficient manner. A review of the numerical formulation and the discretization schemes utilized for the convective fluxes is also presented. Several test cases in two- and three-dimensions are examined for validation purposes and to illustrate the performance of the solver in addressing complex nonequilibrium flows.},

@article{Spalart2009,
   abstract = {Detached-eddy simulation (DES) was first proposed in 1997 and first used in 1999, so its full history can be surveyed. A DES community has formed, with adepts and critics, as well as new branches. The initial motivation of high–Reynolds number, massively separated flows remains, for which DES is convincingly more capable presently than either unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or large-eddy simulation (LES). This review discusses compelling examples, noting the visual and quantitative success of DES. Its principal weakness is its response to ambiguous grids, in which the wall-parallel grid spacing is of the order of the boundary-layer thickness. In some situations, DES on a given grid is then less accurate than RANS on the same grid or DES on a coarser grid. Partial remedies have been found, yet dealing with thickening boundary layers and shallow separation bubbles is a central challenge. The nonmonotonic response of DES to grid refinement is disturbing to most observers, as is the absence of a theoretical order of accuracy. These issues also affect LES in any nontrivial flow. This review also covers the numerical needs of DES, gridding practices, coupling with different RANS models, derivative uses such as wall modeling in LES, and extensions such as zonal DES and delayed DES.},

Some earlier history of the progress in weather prediction is included if relevant. Only direct simulation, in which all scales of turbulence are accounted for explicitly, and large-eddy simulation, in which the effect of the smaller scales is modeled, are discussed. The method by which all scales are modeled, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes, is not covered.},

   abstract = {<p>A hypersonic, spatially evolving turbulent boundary layer at Mach 12.48 with a cooled wall is analysed by means of direct numerical simulations. At the selected conditions, massive kinetic-to-internal energy conversion triggers thermal and chemical non-equilibrium phenomena. Air is assumed to behave as a five-species reacting mixture, and a two-temperature model is adopted to account for vibrational non-equilibrium. Wall cooling partly counteracts the effects of friction heating, and the temperature rise in the boundary layer excites vibrational energy modes while inducing mild chemical dissociation of oxygen. Vibrational non-equilibrium is mostly driven by molecular nitrogen, characterized by slower relaxation rates than the other molecules in the mixture. The results reveal that thermal non-equilibrium is sustained by turbulent mixing: sweep and ejection events efficiently redistribute the gas, contributing to the generation of a vibrationally under-excited state close to the wall, and an over-excited state in the outer region of the boundary layer. The tight coupling between turbulence and thermal effects is quantified by defining an interaction indicator. A modelling strategy for the vibrational energy turbulent flux is proposed, based on the definition of a vibrational turbulent Prandtl number. The validity of the strong Reynolds analogy under thermal non-equilibrium is also evaluated. Strong compressibility effects promote the translational–vibrational energy exchange, but no preferential correlation was detected between expansions/compressions and vibrational over-/under-excitation, as opposed to what has been observed for unconfined turbulent configurations.</p>},

We stress that DNS is a research tool, and not a brute-force solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for engineering problems. The wide range of scales in turbulent flows requires that care be taken in their numerical solution. We discuss related numerical issues such as boundary conditions and spatial and temporal discretization. Significant insight into turbulence physics has been gained from DNS of certain idealized flows that cannot be easily attained in the laboratory. We discuss some examples. Further, we illustrate the complementary nature of experiments and computations in turbulence research. Examples are provided where DNS data has been used to evaluate measurement accuracy. Finally, we consider how DNS has impacted turbulence modeling and provided further insight into the structure of turbulent boundary layers.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Aero-optical effects caused by hypersonic turbulence will affect the accuracy of optical sensors on aircraft. Traditional analysis methods, which do not consider absorption and scattering effects, cannot easily be used to completely describe the transmission process of light in hypersonic turbulence. In this paper, an aero-optical effect analysis method based on photon Monte Carlo simulation (MC-AOEA) was proposed to explain the distortion characteristics of aero-optical effects from the perspective of photon statistics. The energy distribution of photons in the transmission process was determined by taking a photon packet as a unit, and the microscopic statistics of the photon dissipation energy for all photon packets were calculated. The effectiveness of this method was verified by comparing the photon statistical parameters with the traditional optical distortion physical quantities. MC-AOEA was used to analyze the distortion of aero-optical effects at different altitudes and speeds. Additionally, the simulation results showed that, with the reduction in flight altitude and the enhancement of speed, the distortion of aero-optical effects was aggravated, and the energy loss was more serious, which provides a reference for the evaluation of aero-optical effect errors.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The aero-optical effect of hypersonic flight vehicles creates serious distortion on the imaging system. In this paper, based on the 2D model of a typical optical seeker, flow field density data are obtained by numerical simulation with different optical seeker head radii, cone angles, and relative positions of incident rays reaching the window as variables. Through a series of evaluation parameters, the aero-optical effect under different conditions is quantitatively computed by a ray tracing method. The results show that with the increase of the line of sight (LOS) angle, image deviation decreases. When the optical seeker radius is 40 mm and the cone angle is more than 20°, image deviation will not change with the increase of the cone angle. In the case of a small cone angle, the bore sight error (BSE) decreases gradually with the increase of LOS angle. The BSE decreases with the increase of the cone angle, and tends to be stable when the cone angle is above 40°. The variation of the optical path difference with respect to the flow field density is more sensitive than the distance from the shock wave region to the optical seeker window. The Strehl ratio decreases with the increase of the optical seeker cone angle, indicating that the larger the cone angle, the worse the imaging quality.</p>},
